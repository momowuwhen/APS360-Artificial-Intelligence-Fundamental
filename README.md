Plus project of identifying mushroom edibility from image

Lab1: 

      -Perform basic PyTorch tensor operations;

      -Load data into PyTorch;
      
      -Configure an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch;
      
      -Train ANNs using PyTorch;
      
      -Evaluate different ANN configuations.

Lab2: 

      -Understand at a high level the training loop for a machine learning model;

      -Understand the distinction between training, validation, and test data;
      
      -Understand the concepts of overfitting and underfitting;
      
      -Investigate how different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, affect the success of training;
      
      -Compare an ANN (aka Multi-Layer Perceptron) with a CNN.

Lab3: 
      
      -Generate and preprocess my own data;

      -Load and split data for training, validation and testing;
      
      -Train a Convolutional Neural Network;
      
      -Apply transfer learning to improve my model.

Lab4: 
      
      -Clean and process continuous and categorical data for machine learning;

      -Implement an autoencoder that takes continuous and categorical (one-hot) inputs;
      
      -Tune the hyperparameters of an autoencoder;
      
      -Use baseline models to help interpret model performance.

Lab5: 

      -Clean and process text data for machine learning;

      -Understand and implement a character-level recurrent neural network;
      
      -Use torchtext to build recurrent neural network models;
      
      -Understand batching for a recurrent neural network, and use torchtext to implement RNN batching.
